# Dataset

The dataset is a combination of two datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 
The first is a [food waste dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapaital/food-waste) by sector (retail, food services, and household) for all countries.
The second is an [extreme poverty dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/extreme-poverty) that shows the percentage of the population living under $30 USD a day for a given year.
In this combined dataset, the last year when poverty was measured for a country is used and noted under the "Year" column in the CSV file.
